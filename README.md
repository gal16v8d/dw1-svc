# DW1-Service

A Mongo + Express + Node.js + Typescript app to expose a REST API
with some useful info around the PS1 game Digimon World 1.

### Artillery tests

- see: https://www.artillery.io/

### Deploy to heroku (Deprecation Path)

- heroku login
- git push heroku main

I am looking for alternatives to Heroku since free dynos will be removed
soon, so this repo was moved to Github in order to explore railway.app and
cyclic.sh as alternatives
