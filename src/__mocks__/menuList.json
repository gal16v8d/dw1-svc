The clock runs on a 24-hour system, and you will find that certain events occur during the day while others happen at night. The clock's hand moves around once every hour. The white dot that circulates the outside of the clock will tell you what time it is.  When the dot is at the top of the circle, it is night. When it is at the bottom, it is daytime. You can tell what time of day it is by the pictures on the clock. Red denotes sunset and purple denotes sunrise.",
